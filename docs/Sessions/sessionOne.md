# Session One

## Summary

Lyall, Marxx, and Ru entered the dungeon with the instructions from Enereg Mith to exit with the adventurer's crests hidden within. Upon entering they noticed that the bridge in the first room was collapsed. To get over Ru knocked down a pillar and Lyall and Marxx used it to get to the other side. They entered the main room and went to the door to the right. Ru found some dwarven runes that were scratched into the wall by the door. These runes depicted dwarves, elves, a deity and some unrecognizable creatures. Inside the door they met two fungi coated creatures who attacked them when Marxx touched the spoke in the center of the room. Ru and Marxx both went down throughout the fight but in the end they defeated the fungus creatures noticing that they were made of both fungi and bone. They then fixed the gears on the wall and noticed that the spoke was still locked in place by a third channel of wall gears. The party then returned to the main room and investigated the door to the north. Marxx and Lyall successfully crossed the large mushrooms spanning the main room while Ru flew over. They found that it had some kind of contraption that accepts a sphere to its side. The door was otherwise locked. Lyall turned into a mouse and investigated the other side. He found some large cogs that looked like they were in working order and a staircase going up. He exited the room, reverting back to a humanoid. Ru investigated the left most door and found it was locked, she then investigated the gear box on the roof seeing that it worked in conjunction with some gear teeth on the domed roof. Ru attempted and failed to open the box. Lyall and Marxx started a short rest but were interrupted when a fungal tendril laid across Lyall's lap, initiative started and he took necrotic damage.
