# The Adventurer's Guild
The Adventurer's Guild was founded as a means to control the increasing population of opportunistic monsters and to explore the vast array of uncovered ruins.

## Borderless and Boundless
Adventurers that bear the mark of the guild are generally admitted in any country regardless of their homeland. It is expected that adventurers remain neutral during times of war or political turmoil once accepting and carrying out a contract.

## Always Available
Most towns and cities have an area dedicated to the Adventure's Guild. These areas can range from a great manned keep to a backroom in a bar. Each dedicated area will, at minimum, have the means of fulfilling contracts and accepting new ones.


## Militias Overwhelmed
As monsters became more prevalent local militias and guard watches became overwhelmed, trying to be exterminators while conducting their normal duties. The Adventurer's Guild was initially formed to deal with the increasing monster threat and alleviate the pressure on local enforcement forces.
