# The Campaign

## Adventure Hook
An ancient and mysterious calamity caused the ruin of civilization and the disappearance of the gods from the mortal plane. Since then civilization has rebuilt itself, but no one seems to know why it collapsed in the first place or why the gods haven't returned.


## Homebrew Rules
### Quick initiative
An initiative order will be determined at the start of the session by comparing initiative modifiers. If modifiers are the same then a contested DEX check will determine the order. This initiative order will be used ONLY for quick events like the triggering of traps. 

### Nat 20 saving throws
If a player rolls a natural 20 on a saving throw and the natural 20 plus their modifiers pass the DC for the save then the PC takes no damage instead of half damage.

### Better traps
PCs will now gain one round of initiative when a trap is activated. This time can be taken to try and disarm the trap or HELP the player who activated it.
