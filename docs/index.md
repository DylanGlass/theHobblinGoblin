# The Campaign




## Homebrew Rules
### Quick initiative
An initiative order will be determined at the start of the session by comparing initiative modifiers. If modifiers are the same then a contested DEX check will determine the order. This initiative order will be used ONLY for quick events like the triggering of traps. 

### Nat 20 saving throws
If a player rolls a natural 20 on a saving throw and the natural 20 plus their modifiers pass the DC for the save then the PC takes no damage instead of half damage.

### Better traps
PCs will now gain one round of initiative when a trap is activated. This time can be taken to try and disarm the trap or HELP the player who activated it.
