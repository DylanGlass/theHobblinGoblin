# The Gods
In Guia there is a single god for each cleric domain. These gods are referred to by many names, but the most common is to use the name of their domain to address them (e.g. Arcane, or Goddess of the Arcane). 

## Alignment
Each god is considered to be unaligned as their actions and motives are interpreted differently depending on who you ask.

## The Decent
It is believed that the gods descended to the mortal plane ages ago to live among their creations. This was denoted as the zeroth year in history and was thought to have brought about a golden age.

## Gone without a Trace
Sometime after **The Decent**, and long before modern day a calamity struck the world causing a collapse of civilization. After this event the gods were nowhere to be found.
