## Session Summary 

Ru noticed one of Dr. Weirdwood's lab benches move. Intro to Iris. Saw Simon Kipp half blown apart from igniting his powder pack to save himself from a creature attacking him. Went to the site of explosion and found rat tracks leading to the Black Well. Went down the black well, found two goblins who turned out to be wood cutouts. Were attacked by giant rats and spider-rat abominations.
