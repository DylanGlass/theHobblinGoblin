## Mysterious Origin. 
Nobody really knows the true 
nature of the false hydra. Scholars the world over are
left guessing as to the true nature of these creatures. 
What is known is that by the time their presence is 
apparent, it is often too late. The false hydra begins its
life cycle as a lump of white flesh, growing and festering
deep beneath the ground of a town or city. Their genesis
is brought on by an abundance of lies and half-truths 
told by members of a community. Often these creatures
manifest in kingdoms where propaganda has become
out of control. Eventually, the small fleshy mass, no larger
than a fist, grows to the size of a small child and sprouts
a single head on a prehensile neck. This is when the false
hydra truly begins its cycle. It burrows up through the
ground until it reaches the surface, or a chamber with
easy access to the surface of the ground such as a sewer, 
cave, or castle basement. Once it emerges, the false hydra
begins to sing a deep and guttural dirge that can be faintly
heard for miles around. This song makes all who hear it
unable to perceive the false hydra. This is not invisibility, 
but something much more insidious. The false hydra 
removes itself from the mind of every sentient creature 
that can hear its song, meaning it can still be seen, but it
is immediately forgotten by those who see it even as they 
stare directly at its moony face.
## Confabulation. 
As the hydra begins to feed on the people
of a town in order to grow larger and sprout more heads, 
locals are destined to notice something is amiss. They are
going to wonder where the local priest has gone, or why 
their loved ones are no longer in town. The false hydra’s 
song will cause people to create new memories to make 
their new reality logical. those under the effects of the song
might say things like “the baker isn’t just missing,  he left
town to fight in the king’s army”. These logical leaps
become increasingly more difficult to justify as more people
go missing. For example, someone who’s husband has been 
eaten by the false hydra might try to justify all the men’s 
clothing in their home by saying a visiting relative left them
there. To an outsider, things will be obviously wrong, and to
those trapped under the false hydra’s influence, the mounting
weight of all this cognitive dissonance is liable to lead to 
madness. 
## Horrid Growth. 
The false hydra’s hunger knows no bounds.
As the creature eats and grows both in size and number of
heads, it becomes more bold. Once it has fully grown to a
state of maturity it will drop all pretence and emerge from
the ground as a mature false hydra. It then begins to sing
a different song, one that dominates and enslaves the vast
majority of those who hear it. The false hydra will have all
who are able to resist its domination rounded up and eaten
until it is sure that the remaining members of the population
are enslaved to it. It will then have its thralls carry it on their
backs to the next town, where it will continue to dominate
and consume in a futile attempt to quench the unending
appetite it holds. Eventually, the false hydra will become so
large that it must be pulled by its thralls. It will have the
creatures it is dominating wrap chains and rope around its
body and drag the monster ever onward in a tour of blood 
and gore. Eventually, the false hydra will gorge itself into 
a non-sustainable position where it becomes impossible
to eat enough to sustain its form. The least moments of a
false hydra are usually spent gorging on its thralls in a final
attempt to satisfy its appetite.
## Entropic Ends. 
A false hydra will always inexorably eat
itself to death. The only question is whether it takes days,
weeks, months, or years. the best way to avoid a catastrophic
result when a false hydra becomes a problem is to simply
avoid it and remove its food supply. The ultimate safeguard, 
however, is prevention.
