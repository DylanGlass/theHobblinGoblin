## Session Summary 

When the violet tendril laid across Lyall's lap it began to decay his clothing. Lyall sprang into action casting thorn whip at the purple cap of the mushroom that had crawled up the side of the suspended platform. Lyall landed a critical hit, causing the mushroom to release its grip on the platform and fall into the blackness. Ru tried to open the gearbox a second time and succeeded, she found that the gears connected to a toothed strip on the domed metal roof. Lyall used wild shape to enter the northmost room, snuck up to the second floor and pulled the lever that unlocked the gear mechanism. He saw some more of the violet fungi growing in the room. Ru returned to the eastern room and turned the spoke wheel which slightly opened the roof and let in some sunlight. The three main mushrooms shrunk away from the light. Ru also found Marxx's adventurers insignia and an orb that she used to open the northmost door and free Lyall. The party then repelled with two 50ft ropes to the basement from the northern platform with Lyall slipping up and taking fall damage. Once at the bottom they found the stain left from the violet fungi that fell and three more doors. They entered the westmost door to find a caged elevator that they cautiously fiddled with. After returning to the main room they went to the easternmost door and found a lever, a chest, and a floating fungal creature. Ru checked the chest and found Lyall's insignia. Marxx pulled the lever. Lyall killed the floating fungus which released spoors, diseasing himself and Marxx. Lyall cast lesser restoration on himself and Marxx to remove the disease. The party then saw a crack/tiny hole in the wall which they tried to make bigger. After two failed attempts Marxx looked through it to see a large room. While peering through a large eye moved in front of the other side and peered back. The party returned to the main room and entered the northmost room and found it empty and strangely clean. Ru finally found her insignia in the middle of the room on a spoke wheel. The walls began to ooze sludge and eyes and initiative began. 
- Saw brown/green fungus and violet mushrooms with tendrils.
- Realized there were two entities involved.
- The party heard the words "Kill it" in their mind after breathing in spores released by one of the creatures.
- Turned the spoke wheel and descended into what looked like an old mineshaft. All tunnels but one were collapsed.
- A giant eye on a fungal stock descended after them along with ooze containing dead looking eyes and violet tendrils. 
- Ru investigated the eye stock before plummeting to the bottom of the hole to get out of its way.
- Lyall cremated large portions of the fungal growth.
- Switched to the violet mushrooms that were seemingly attached to the eye's stock.
- Marxx obliterated the stock of one violet mushrooms and took a swing at another.
