# Adventure Hook

Protect the town of Avia and make sure the Night of the Owl festival runs smoothly for all seven of its days.


## Six Truths of The City

1.  The town of Avia and its people worship the sun as a god and birds as the beings closest to it.
2. The subtropical woods surrounding Avia are wild and magical, most townsfolk understand the language of the woods and know to be weary as monsters are common and lurk within the shadows.
3. The village folk accept monsters of the woods as a part of everyday life and either befriend them or take precautions to defend against them.
4. Avia is extremely secluded. Visitors are rare and caravans hauling goods arrive or depart sparsely.
5. The cliffs around Avia contain more than valuable gems.
6. An ambitious being seeks the secrets that are hidden in the cliff's stone.
