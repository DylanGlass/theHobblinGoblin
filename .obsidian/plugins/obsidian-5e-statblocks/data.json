During a long rest, a charmed creature makes a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, their subconscious mind will  reach out to them in an attempt to warn them of the false hydra’s presence, possibly in the form of a note scrawled as they slept or by some other means at the DM’s discretion.
